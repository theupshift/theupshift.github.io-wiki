<p class="mb5">The <b>Log</b> is a personal log and time-tracking system I created to help me see where and how much time is spent on. The Log is inspired by similar systems by <a class="fwb" href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Horaire/" target="_blank" title="~ Horaire">Neauoire<span class="fwn red">&deg;</span></a>, <a class="fwb" href="https://log.v-os.ca/" target="_blank" title="~ The V-OS Log">vi<span class="fwn red">&deg;</span></a>, and <a class="fwb" href="http://xla.wiki/" target="_blank" title="~ Deuveir">Deuveir<span class="fwn red">&deg;</span></a>.</p>

<h3 class="mb3 f3">System</h3>
<p class="mb3">Logging activities involves terminal input. The logs are stored in .txt and .js files, which can then be viewed on a browser.</p>
<p class="mb4">To start a log:</p>
<p class="mb4 bg-noir blanc p4 mon f6">$ log {Category} {Title} "Description"<br>$ log COD Memex "Updating website"</p>
<p class="mb4">To end a log:</p>
<p class="mb4 bg-noir blanc p4 mon f6">$ log e</p>
<p>At the end of a logged session, the Log will ask if I had accomplished what I had set out to do. If I did, the log entry is uploaded onto Rotonde to be shared with my network.
