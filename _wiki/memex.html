<p class="mb4">The <b>Memex</b> is a personal wiki about my oeuvre, research, and general existence.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 f5">Build</h3>
<p class="mb4">The Memex is built with <a class="fwb" href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" title="~ Jekyll is a static site generator">Jekyll<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a> and <a class="fwb" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" title="~ GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a>. Information herein is written and stored in _wiki and _data. Its look and layout was built with {{ site.data.dir.macian }}.</p>

<p class="mb3">My friend <a class="fwb" href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/" title="~ Devine is a nomad developer and designer.">Devine Lu Linvega<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a>, in his talk &ldquo;<a class="fwb" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5bbJcimCcs" title="~ Watch it">The Frameworks for Mystics<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a>&rdquo; at <a class="fwb" href="http://www.a-maze.net/" target="_blank" title="~ A MAZE.">A MAZE<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a> in Berlin (2015), brought up the idea of a website that contains everything an individual knows so that it knows enough to predict what that person should know. It's a very interesting idea that I would love to continue to explore.</p>
<p class="mb4">The term <i>memex</i> comes from <a class="fwb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="~ Vannevar Bush was an American engineer, inventor and science administrator.">Vanner Bush's<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a> 1945 <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> article &ldquo;<a class="fwb" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/" title="~ Article link">As We May Think<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a>.&rdquo; The memex is described as &ldquo;a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility&rdquo; and an &ldquo;enlarged intimate supplement to memory.&rdquo;</p>
