<p class="mb3 lhd"><b title="Translates to 'boat' in French">Bateau</b> is the secondary vessel of exploration in my Journey across Mithvaer.</p>

<p class="mb4 lhd">In the Earthly realm, Bateau is an old laptop which, just like Navire, is not a powerful machine, but it at least allows me to create things, which is all that matters. Bateau serves as a portable workstation whenever I'm not in the comfort of home.</p>
