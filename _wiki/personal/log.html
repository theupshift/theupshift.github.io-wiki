<p class="mb4">The <b>Log</b> is a personal log and time-tracking system I created to help me see where and how much time is spent on. The Log is inspired by similar systems by Neauoire, vi, and deuveir.</p>
<h3 class="mb3 f6 upc tk bb pb3">System</h3>
<p class="mb3">Logging activities involves terminal input. The logs are stored in .txt and .js files, which can then be viewed using on a browser.</p>
<p class="mb3">To start a log:</p>
<p class="mb3 bg-noir blanc p4 mon f6">$ log {Category} {Title} "Description"<br><br>$ log COD Memex "Updating website"</p>
<p class="mb3">To end a log:</p>
<p class="mb3 bg-noir blanc p4 mon f6">$ log e</p>
<p class="mb4">At the end of a logged session, the Log will ask if I had accomplished what I had set out to do. If I did, the log entry is uploaded onto Rotonde to be shared with my network.
