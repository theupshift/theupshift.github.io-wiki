<p class="mb4">The <b>Pixelattire</b> project is a <a class="fwb" href="https://pixelattire.tumblr.com/" title="~ Pixelattire" target="_blank">visual log<span class="red fwn">&deg;</span></a> of what I wear everyday throughout 2018, where I create pixel art self-portraits to document my (lack of) fashion sense. It additionally serves as an excuse to practice pixel art daily.</p>
