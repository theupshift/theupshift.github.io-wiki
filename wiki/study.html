But learning shouldn't be reserved for academic environments; I'd argue that learning is much better outside of school.</p><blockquote><p class="q">&ldquo;I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. [...] It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones&rdquo;</p><p class="a">&mdash; Arthur Conan Doyle, <a href="https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/pdf/a4/1-sided/stud.pdf">A Study in Scarlet</a></p></blockquote><p>Curate what you learn. The world is full of information but much of it is just noise. Trivial things like celebrity birthdays and accounting are hardly worth knowing. Knowledge should be applicable for it to be of value.</p><blockquote><p class="q">&ldquo;Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach&rdquo;</p><p class="a">&mdash; Aristotle</p></blockquote></main><footer><p><a href="josh.html">J</a> © 2017&ndash;2019</p><a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random"><img id="w"src="m/r.svg"alt="Ring"></a><a href="https://merveilles.town/@joshavanier"target="_blank"><img id="m"src="m/m.svg"alt="Town"></a></footer><script src="../s.js"></script>
