Academia changed that with its flawed system where you essentially just have to memorise and retain knowledge up until the exams are over. Plus the curriculum is a medley of information that is mostly irrelevant to students' individual interests. And so now I only "study" for the&nbsp;diploma.</p><blockquote><p class="q">Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. The only function of a school is to make self-education easier; failing that, it does nothing.<p class="a">&mdash; Isaac Asimov, How to Write 148 Books Without Really Trying</blockquote><p>Learning new things is great as it extends the perimeters of our minds. But it shouldn't be reserved for academic environments; I'd argue that learning is much better done outside of school and at one's own pace and&nbsp;interest.</p><h2>Attic Theory</h2><p>Nowadays I mostly learn things on an as-needed basis like if a project requires a certain skill to accomplish for&nbsp;example.</p><blockquote><p class="q">I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.

The world is full of information but much of it is just noise. Trivial things like celebrity birthdays and accounting are hardly worth knowing. Knowledge should be applicable for it to be of&nbsp;value.</p></main><a id="c"href="copyright.html">© 2017–2019</a>
