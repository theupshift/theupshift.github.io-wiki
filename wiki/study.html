This is mostly due to the way the education system works. School is simply a memory training camp; all you have to do is retain knowledge until the examinations are over.</p><blockquote><p class="q">Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. The only function of a school is to make self-education easier; failing that, it does nothing.<p class="a">&mdash; Isaac Asimov</blockquote><p>It's good to keep on learning new things to further extend the perimeters of our minds. But learning shouldn't be reserved for academic environments; I'd argue that learning is much better outside of school.</p><h2>Attic Theory</h2><blockquote><p class="q">I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.

The world is full of information but much of it is just noise. Trivial things like celebrity birthdays and accounting are hardly worth knowing. Knowledge should be applicable for it to be of value.</p><blockquote><p class="q">Learning never exhausts the mind.<p class="a">&mdash; Leonardo da Vinci</blockquote></main><a id="c"href="copyright.html">© 2017–2019</a><script src="../s.js"></script>
