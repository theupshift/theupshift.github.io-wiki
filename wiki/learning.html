But learning shouldn't be reserved for academic environments; I'd argue that learning is much better outside of school.</p><blockquote><p class="q">I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. [&hellip;] It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones</p><p class="a">Arthur Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet</p></blockquote><p>Curate what you learn. The world is full of information but much of it is just noise. Trivial things like celebrity birthdays and accounting are hardly worth knowing.</p><blockquote><p class="q">Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do</p><p class="a">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p></blockquote><p>Knowledge should be applicable somehow in our lives in order for it to be of value.</p></main><footer><a title="Ring" href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random" target="_blank"><img id="w" src="../img/rotonde.svg" alt="Webring"></a><a title="Town" href="https://merveilles.town/@joshavanier" target="_blank"><img id="m" src="../img/merveilles.svg" alt="Merveilles"></a><p><a title="Josh Avanier" href="./josh.html">JA</a> Â© 2017&ndash;2019</footer><script src="../search.js"></script>
