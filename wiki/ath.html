This was created to chronicle my projects and compile knowledge relevant to the life I strive to live. I hope this also inspire others in some way.</p><img src="m/hexagram.png"><h2>Structure</h2><p>The Ath is built on top of stripped down variants of <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/#devine+lu+linvega"target="_blank">Neauoire's</a> <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/#oscean"target="_blank">Oscean</a> wiki engine and <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/#indental"target="_blank">Indental</a> format. Pages are generated from a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-file_database"target="_blank">flat-file database</a>.</p><p>There are five page types &mdash; home, portal, project, commonplace, and status. <a href="./oeuvre.html">Portals</a> contain indexes of pages under their category. Project pages contain information about a project, including summaries from my <a href="./log.html">time-tracking</a> data. <a href="./commonplace.html">Commonplace</a> pages contain unstructured notes. The <a href="./status.html">Status</a> page details the wiki's status &mdash; completion of documentation, missing elements, etc.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Inspired by Low-Tech Magazine's <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com"target="_blank">solar site</a>, the Ath is designed to be simple with only the elements essential for a pure reading experience. Much of its CSS is dedicated to legibility rather than decor. This keeps the site light and fast.</p><p>There are no ads, tracking scripts, or popups. The only JavaScript code that runs on this site are a couple of scripts that handle search and the 404 router.</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>A <a href="https://athenaeum.now.sh"target="_blank">mirror site</a> is also deployed on <a href="https://zeit.co/now"target="_blank">ZEIT Now</a>.<li>A dat:// mirror and an RSS feed are coming soon.</ul><div id="l"><span title="140617&ndash;270219">BL1&ndash;2E3</span> 245.94 <span title="Development">102.95D</span> <span title="Visual">90.07V</span> <span title="Research">52.92R</span></div></main><a href="copyright.html">&copy; 2017&ndash;2019</a><script src="../s.js"></script>
