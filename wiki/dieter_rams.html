The designer must be the gestaltingenieur or creative engineer. They synthesize the completed product from the various elements that make up its design. Their work is largely rational, meaning that aesthetic decisions are justified by an understanding of the product’s purpose.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="q">‎To use design to impress, to polish things up, to make them chic, is no design at all. This is packaging. When we concentrate on the essential elements in design, when we omit all superfluous elements, we find forms become: quiet, comfortable, understandable and, most importantly, long lasting.</p></blockquote></main><footer><a title="Ring" href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random" target="_blank"><img id="w" src="../img/rotonde.svg" alt="Webring"></a><a title="Town" href="https://merveilles.town/@joshavanier" target="_blank"><img id="m" src="../img/merveilles.svg" alt="Merveilles"></a><p><a title="Josh Avanier" href="./josh.html">JA</a> © 2017&ndash;2019</footer><script src="../search.js"></script>
